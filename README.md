The Unsplash React component uses [grid-view](https://github.com/lucholaf/react-native-grid-view) in order to showcase grid layout. whereas the pixa bay component uses flex properties to achieve the same grid system.

**Please note:**<br/>
In order to run the project, make sure you place the Unsplash, pixabay api keys in constant.js
